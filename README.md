# Interactive Keyboard

This interactive keyboard is a fun and functional project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by a CodePen creation, it leverages the power of Flexbox for layout and SCSS for styling to create a visually appealing and responsive keyboard experience.

## Features

- **Flexbox Layout:** Leveraging the Flexbox layout model ensures that the keyboard adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a responsive and consistent user interface.

- **SCSS Styling:** The use of SCSS enhances the maintainability of styles, making it easy to customize and extend the visual design of the keyboard.

- **JavaScript Functionality:** The keyboard's interactivity is powered by JavaScript, handling key presses and updating the display dynamically.
